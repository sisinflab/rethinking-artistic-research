## Scope

Artistic research is increasingly shaped by intelligent visual and interactive interfaces: generative image and sound tools, multimodal dashboards, interactive repositories, and mixed reality environments. These systems do not merely accelerate production; they transform how artists inquire, document, and disseminate knowledge—redistributing agency among artists, AI models, datasets, platforms, and institutions.

At the same time, the rapid adoption of generative AI raises methodological, epistemic, and ethical challenges for artistic research. Questions of authorship and accountability, the role of data infrastructures, the legibility of machine mediation, and the sustainability of creative ecosystems become central. As artistic practice and education integrate AI-enabled tools, a critical need emerges for **human-centred approaches** and **interaction paradigms** that make agency visible, negotiable, and contestable—while supporting inclusive participation, learning, and long-term stewardship of cultural and research outputs.

This workshop, **“Rethinking Artistic Research in the Age of AI: New Frameworks, HCAI Practices, and Challenges”** (AVI 2026), provides a forum for HCI researchers, designers, artists, and art educators to:
1) map current and emerging interaction paradigms for AI-supported artistic research;  
2) discuss responsible, inclusive, and sustainable approaches to intelligent interfaces in artistic contexts; and  
3) share design cases, prototypes, repositories, and critical reflections that foreground artistic agency and creative self-actualization.

We particularly welcome contributions grounded in practice (including work developed in art academies and universities), as well as submissions that engage critically with the implications of AI infrastructures, institutional settings, and socio-cultural contexts.

## Topics

Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:

### AI, Art, and Creativity
- Generative AI workflows for artistic inquiry (image, sound, video, multimodal)
- Co-creation and mixed-initiative systems for creative practice
- Critical perspectives on automation, authorship, originality, and style

### Human-Centred AI and Interaction Paradigms
- Interfaces that surface agency, provenance, and model/data influence
- Explainability, legibility, and control in creative AI tools
- Interaction techniques for prompting, steering, critiquing, and iterative refinement
- Methodologies for designing *with* artists and art schools

### Learning Ecosystems, CSCW, and Institutional Practices
- Platforms and repositories supporting artistic research and documentation
- Collaborative systems for studios, labs, archives, and classrooms
- Pedagogical tools for AI literacy and critical making in art education

### Responsible, Inclusive, and Ethical Design
- Diversity, equity, and inclusion in creative AI interfaces and datasets
- Governance, accountability, and institutional policies for AI in artistic research
- Harms, biases, and cultural implications of generative systems
- Sustainability and long-term maintenance of tools, datasets, and practices

### Cultural Heritage and Digital Humanities
- Interfaces and pipelines for digitization, restoration, and interpretation
- Creative reuse, remix, and participatory heritage experiences
- Ethical curation, provenance, and cultural rights in AI-mediated heritage work

### Health, Well-being, and Self-Actualization
- Interfaces supporting reflective practice, identity, and self-expression
- Therapeutic, care-oriented, or community-based creative technologies
- Evaluation of well-being impacts in AI-supported artistic practice

## Submissions

We invite the following submission types (in English, PDF):

### Full Papers (research/design cases)
Full papers should report substantial contributions of lasting value, including design cases, conceptual frameworks, methodological contributions, and evaluations.  
**Length:** *TBA* pages (plus references).

### Short Papers (work-in-progress / methodological reflections)
Short papers present promising work not yet mature for a full paper, early results, or focused methodological/critical contributions.  
**Length:** *TBA* pages (plus references).

### Demo / Poster Extended Abstracts
We strongly encourage **live demos** of tools and platforms used in art academies and universities, including early-stage prototypes and speculative interfaces. Poster submissions may include work-in-progress, reflective accounts, and infrastructural contributions (datasets, repositories, workflows).  
**Length:** *TBA* pages (plus references).

### Position / Discussion Papers
Position papers propose novel ideas, articulate open challenges, or reframe unresolved problems in artistic research and HCAI. They should motivate a focused discussion and provide a clear agenda for future work.  
**Length:** *TBA* pages (plus references).

Submissions may range from theoretical contributions to system descriptions and practice-based research. We particularly welcome submissions from PhD candidates, early-career researchers, and practitioners, as well as contributions from industry and funded projects relevant to the workshop themes.

## Review process and criteria

All submissions will undergo a peer-review process. Reviews will consider:
- **Relevance** to the workshop scope and AVI 2026 themes  
- **Originality** and contribution to knowledge/practice  
- **Clarity** and quality of argumentation/presentation  
- **Methodological soundness** (as appropriate to the submission type)  
- **Potential to stimulate discussion** in the workshop community  

The review model (single-blind/double-blind) will be specified in the final call (*TBA*).

## Presentation and participation

Accepted contributions will be presented as:
- short talks (for selected papers), and/or  
- demo/poster pitches and interactive session (for demos/posters).

At least one author of each accepted contribution must register for AVI 2026 and attend the workshop.

## Proceedings (planned)

Accepted peer-reviewed contributions will be published in an open-access **CEUR-WS.org** workshop proceedings volume. Demo and poster contributions may be included as extended abstracts in the same volume and/or made available through the workshop website and the P+ARTS online repository to ensure long-term visibility and accessibility.

Template and formatting instructions for the proceedings will be provided (*TBA*).

## Submission instructions

- **Submission system:** *TBA* (e.g., EasyChair link/track)  
- **File format:** PDF  
- **Language:** English  
- **Anonymity:** *TBA* (depending on the review model)  

## Important dates

- Paper submission deadline: **TBA**  
- Notification of acceptance: **TBA**  
- Camera-ready deadline: **TBA**  
- Workshop date: **TBA** (at AVI 2026)  

Deadlines refer to **23:59 AoE (Anywhere on Earth)** unless otherwise stated.
