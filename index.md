# Rethinking Artistic Research in the Age of AI  
### New Frameworks, HCAI Practices, and Challenges  
**Workshop at [AVI 2026](https://www.unive.it/web/en/15667/home)**

Artistic research is increasingly conducted through intelligent visual and interactive interfaces: generative image and sound tools, multimodal dashboards, interactive repositories, and mixed reality environments. These systems reshape how artists inquire, document, and share knowledge, redistributing agency among artists, AI models, datasets, and institutions.

This workshop explores how advanced visual interfaces—possibly based on intelligent interaction paradigms—can support artistic research in the age of generative AI. We invite contributions that present design cases, prototypes, and critical reflections on tools and environments created **for and with** artists and art schools. Of particular interest are interfaces and **Human-Centred AI** approaches that make agency visible and negotiable, foster critical and ethical stances toward AI, and enable learning ecosystems across academies and universities.

The workshop aims to create a venue where HCI researchers, designers, artists, and art educators can:
1) map current and emerging interaction paradigms for AI-supported artistic research;  
2) discuss responsible and inclusive approaches to intelligent interfaces in artistic contexts; and  
3) share examples of platforms, repositories, and tools that foreground artistic agency and creative self-actualization.

**→ Interested in contributing?** See the [Call for Contributions](./callforpapers/) and the [Program](./schedule/).

## Topics
- AI based Art and Creativity  
- Human-Centred Interaction Paradigms and Tools for Art and Creativity  
- Learning Ecosystems and Computer-Supported Cooperative Work  
- Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion and Responsible Design  
- Cultural Heritage and Digital Humanities  
- Health, Well-being, and Self-Actualization  

## Format (tentative)
Half-day workshop combining a keynote, short talks, and a demo/poster session, followed by a closing discussion. We particularly welcome **live demos** of tools and platforms used in art academies and universities, including early-stage prototypes and speculative interfaces.

A draft program is available in the [Program](/schedule/) page.

## Target audience
Researchers and practitioners at the intersection of artistic research, HCI, and AI: artists, designers, interaction/UX researchers, and technologists engaged with creative practice. Particularly relevant for AFAM institutions and universities running artistic research and doctoral programmes, as well as PhD candidates, post-graduate students, curators, and tool/platform developers.

## Proceedings
Workshop submissions will undergo peer review based on relevance, originality, and clarity. Accepted peer-reviewed contributions will be published in an open-access **CEUR-WS.org** proceedings volume. Demo and poster contributions may be included as extended abstracts and/or made available through the workshop website and the P+ARTS online repository.

## Important dates
- Submission deadline: **March 29, 2026 (23:59 AoE)**
- Notification: **April 10, 2026 (23:59 AoE)**
- Camera-ready: **TBA**
- Workshop date: **TBA** (at AVI 2026)
